# gitwood
`gitwood` is a plug-and-play web frontend for git
(_and will eventually work as a static page generator too._)

Heavily inspired by [stagit](https://codemadness.org/stagit.html) and [cgit](https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/),
but more mobile-friendly and with an additional feature: _issue-like TODOs_.
<!-- Link to #formal_todo_spec once that's written ^ -->
With this addition, `gitwood` can in principle replace heavier git services for simple projects.

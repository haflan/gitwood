Todos here constitutes the gitwood v1 milestone.

TODO [todo_use_id_mapping]: (B) Always refer to todo by ID instead of filename + line num.
_Almost done - what remains: Use a path param instead of query params, so that the link looks like
`/gitwood/-/todo/todo_use_id_mapping`, which is slightly more user friendly._


TODO [todo_details_page]: (A) feature: Todo details page.
In gitwood, a todo for a certain repository is fully identified by these parameters:
---
* commit (hash or ref)
* filename
* line number
---
The todo page handler finds the given file for the given commit and starts reading details from subsequent lines.
Exactly what subsequent lines are treated as todo details depends on the context.
#imp_subseq_line_detection talks more about that.

NOTE [todo_details_page]: In addition to reading all the details about the Todo,
find any mentions of it in the active commit, using its ID.
Mentions should come in two forms: _plain) and _note_.
Plain mentions are all lines that simply contain the Todo ID,
while _notes_ are on the format `NOTE [<todo_id>]: <contents>`.
In the Todo details page, mentions will look similar to Git{hub,lab}'s issue mentions,
e.g. `mentioned in <filename>#<line>`, which will link to the file and line num
(ideally link to associated todos eventually, but that's more complex, also see todo_references).

TODO [prefix_breaks_pages]: (D) bug: The site seems broken when a server prefix is defined

TODO [persistent_and_cache]: (C) feature: Persistent mode, with configurable config directory.
For instance, if a `-p` flag or something (decide details later) is given,
gitwood should create a directory at $GITWOOD_DATADIR (default: `~/.gitwood`),
which should include:
* cache/ : _JSON file containing previously extracted / generated data._
* repos  : _List of repos that should be served_

NOTE [persistent_and_cache]: Cache filename format can look like this:
    filename = sha256sum(projectPath + '@' + commitHash + '@' + operationDetails)[:16] + '.json',
because path, hash and operation (details) fully identifies the data of interest.
With operationDetails, I mean the name of the operation in case of listings,
and name + identifier (like filename and line number) for a single resource.

TODO [todo_details_page]: (B) feature: Todo details page.
In gitwood, a todo for a certain repository is fully identified by these parameters:
* commit (hash or ref)
* filename
* line number
The todo page handler finds the given file for the given commit and starts reading details from subsequent lines.
Exactly what subsequent lines are treated as todo details depends on the context.
imp_subseq_line_detection talks more about that.

NOTE [todo_details_page]: Support Markdown for todo details too?
With [gomarkdown](https://github.com/gomarkdown/markdown) this should be fairly easy,
but don't spend time on it until the todo page is working fine otherwise.

TODO [support_submodules]: feature: Support submodules, both in requests and autoregistry.
Mostly relevant for local (non-bare) git repos, not on servers.

TODO [todo_sort_and_filter]: feature: Add inputs for sorting and filtering todo list. 

TODO [todo_search]: feature: Free text search for todos
This should search in todo details too, so it kinda depends on caching to avoid repeating such a heavy operation.
[fuzzysearch](https://github.com/lithammer/fuzzysearch) is worth considering.

TODO [file_search]: feature: Free text search for file names.
Similar to todo_search.
